# Provenance and acceptance

The starting scaffold is libkore `8a6381c` on `alpha`. The active Rust filesystem
and prelude source, renamed-consumer fixture and three user target descriptions
are adapted from Kore `98289c37c4f51ddcb247f7f0c5f30171399dc3a6` (PR #962):

- `crates/std/src/{lib,fs}.rs` → `src/`
- `tools/std-consumer/` → `tests/consumer/`
- `targets/*-unknown-kore-user.json` → `targets/`

Native owner implementations are exported from the exact later revision in
`native/provenance.json`, including the task-provenance fix exposed by this alpha's
Miri consumer. `make native-check` verifies every exported byte and rejects extra
implementation files. Their licensing is unchanged; `native/LICENSE` retains the
upstream notice. This repository retains its existing `LICENSE`; the
source project's copyright notice is preserved in `docs/KORE-LICENSE` for the
adapted files above. This alpha is not published to a package registry.

The broader approved proposals remain available at their pinned source:
[system library and language surfaces](https://github.com/MicroPerceptron/kore/blob/98289c37c4f51ddcb247f7f0c5f30171399dc3a6/res/SYSTEM_LIBRARY.md)
and [driver development](https://github.com/MicroPerceptron/kore/blob/98289c37c4f51ddcb247f7f0c5f30171399dc3a6/res/DRIVER_DEVELOPMENT.md).
Their proposed foreign APIs and driver recipes are not implied to be implemented
by the native re-exports in this alpha.

The previous placeholder APIs and the alternate address/collection sketches
remain available in Git history. Removing them from the active API avoids
advertising unimplemented allocation or creating a second source of runtime
ownership types.

## Evidence boundaries

This repository checks its resolved package graph, real renamed consumer,
allocation-free feature selection, all-feature build, documentation, Miri, and
the three actual Kore user targets. These are host/compiler checks, not a boot
or device witness. The optional driver feature exposes existing native contracts;
it does not certify arbitrary MMIO recipes or cancellation of active DMA.

At the original facade revision, #962 passed the full host suite, architecture checks,
kernel QEMU boottest and a founded filesystem command gate (write 16 bytes,
shorten to 2, remove). Its production gate twice lacked `net-load: PASS` despite
the other required witnesses completing. That unresolved acceptance result is
not promoted into a full pass by repackaging the library here. No new physical
hardware evidence or foreign-language ABI stability is claimed.

The alpha's Miri check exposed two task-erasure issues in that original runtime:
integer storage lost callable-pointer provenance, and a header-only pointer could
not recover the sibling future storage. The exported revision fixes these with
pointer-typed atomics and a storage-wide pointer derivation, preserving the same
atomic ordering, capacity and allocation behavior. A native regression covers
unadmitted drop, pending/ready polls, wake, and storage reuse; both it and the
facade consumer are included in `make miri`.

For this exported runtime revision, the alpha's host tests, no-default-feature
check, Clippy, generated documentation, owner-graph checks, all three custom
user-target checks and Miri checks passed locally. The local/Git composition
fixture passed its duplicate-owner negative control and native type-identity
checks. The export was also compared directly with the recorded upstream Git
commit using `sync-native.py --check`. Dependency documentation retains existing
upstream warnings; the facade and consumer documentation pass with warnings
denied. The advisory audit is configured in CI but was not run locally.

Kore was rebuilt and revalidated after the runtime repair: the full host suite,
all three architecture checks, separate production/test image builds and kernel
QEMU boottest passed. The production gate again completed the shell and application
seeding witnesses but failed solely on the missing `net-load: PASS` marker. No
clean-main A/B result establishes that failure as pre-existing, and the gate
remains unchanged.

The rebuilt founded filesystem gate also passed after the repair: guest keyboard
input produced the acknowledged 16-byte write, explicit shortening to length 2
and absence after removal, with the final prompt decoded from the real display.
Boot manifests, both architecture payload digests and all shipped lockfiles were
verified again after image generation.

The first GitHub advisory audit passed the facade lockfile and blocked on the
full native lockfile: [RUSTSEC-2026-0192](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2026-0192)
marks `ttf-parser 0.25.1` unmaintained, with no patched version. The dependency
comes from the extraction worker, reachable through native DagFS's optional
`index` feature; it is absent from the facade's current application lockfile.
This is an unmaintained-dependency warning, not a reported vulnerability in this
audit. The inherited `--deny warnings` policy remains enabled. Replacing that
parser belongs in its owning Kore extraction implementation, with its format
contracts and tests validated before re-export; this draft does not suppress the
advisory or silently remove the optional native functionality.
